# Automatic-segmentation-of-glioma-based-on-MRI-K-space-data

Nowadays, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a
pivotal role in gliomas diagnosis, analysis, and surgery
planning. Nevertheless, the accuracy of MRI segmentation is
enormously restricted by the quality of images. Therefore, we
demonstrate a new method that can directly make
segmentations from K space data. And the results show that
our method achieves the state of the art.
